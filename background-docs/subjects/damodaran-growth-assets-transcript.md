1:46
okay folks can you hear
1:55
me okay
2:01
I'm going to try the only way I can check to make sure I'm being heard is if you guys
2:06
settle in right my wife used to teach first grade and she gave me an a
2:12
suggestion because first grade kids sometimes get out of control and she
2:17
said the louder they speak the softer you should speak I've never been able to take her advice now because um so the
2:25
first minute is always going to be chaos in this class because it's a big room
2:31
but I want to First make sure you're in the right class it's the only class that really
2:37
matters that's my personal view now even my valuation class is kind of an add-on I'll talk about why this might be the
2:43
only class you came back to business school for or should be now um but this
2:49
is my 32nd year teaching in this room and I hate this
2:56
room first I mean this is the Ambiance of madis in Square Garden on a bad Nick
3:01
St right it's not exactly a friendly room to be in and the acoustic stink
3:08
stink in what sense I think you guys can hear me when the Architects built this room they
3:14
thought about that they said there's going to be somebody at the front speaking and everybody has to hear you
3:19
know what they did not factor in this is what happens when you let architect build classrooms that if you speak other
3:28
people need to be able to hear and from that perspective this room is terrible so if there's a question from
3:34
this side people on that side can't hear so I'm going to try and I'll keep
3:39
forgetting so remind me when I forget that if there's a question I have to repeat it to make sure that it's in fact
3:46
going to be carried to the other side of the room now since we're adding up yours
3:51
now as I was coming up the elevator I ran into somebody who
3:58
said my mother was in your class I'm getting to a point where
4:05
grandparents are going to be on the on now I've been teaching here since 1986
4:10
you know couple of years they're probably going to next year they'll give me a pin or something which I throw away right away the 40th year it's survival
4:18
prices don't don't you know I'm not that impressed I've managed to stay around but that's not saying much at a business
4:25
school but my very first class was in 1984 four at the University of
4:31
California at Berkeley it was an undergraduate class that I I remember the the T the the numerical code for the
4:38
class ba 130 it was a corporate finance class I was terrified I walked in and to
4:45
be quite honest I didn't know what Corporate Finance was when I walked in and I've tried to figure it out and I think I'm a little further along the
4:52
road than I was in 1984 but the core of the class essentially goes back to where I started
4:58
in 1984 so before we dive into Corporate Finance what it is what we're going to try to
5:03
cover in the class A few logistical details first is I do have an office it's on the ninth floor th this building
5:12
is really three different buildings so there's kch there's Tish so it's in kch
5:18
which is the other building so it's 969 and as you well know these elevators
5:23
don't talk to each other so you take the elevator in the wrong building God help you you're going to get lost you'll never find so take the elevators in the
5:30
other floor 99- 69 my office hours technically at 12 to 115 I'll explain
5:36
what I mean by technically 12 to15 which is right after the class so it's a good time to come and
5:43
ask questions but I am usually in my office around 9:15 getting ready for class 9:30 to 10:15 feel free to drop by
5:52
especially if you have a quick question you want just want to say hi because it's a big class you really don't get
5:57
know drop by and I have a fair fair game principle which is if you find me I'm fair game which means the game starts
6:06
right now which is for the next 15 weeks I'm going to try to make it difficult for you to find me no I'm not going to
6:12
try but I'm going to take the stairs rather than the elevator you know why because I know you guys never take the
6:18
stairs do they still have those signs telling you you should take the stairs I mean for a while they did I think they
6:23
took it down because nobody was following it but truly if you find me
6:28
either in of virtually I tend not to hang out in the social media places you
6:34
might hang out I don't live my life on Twitter or Reddit I won't name the other places
6:40
because I won't embarrass you no definitely not Tik Tok no but if you do find me virtually I'm fair game
6:48
too and that means that it doesn't end after 15 weeks you can hunt me down
6:54
after 15 weeks but then your grade is already in so the fair game principle applies
7:00
I will also during my office hours turn on my have I've set it up for Zoom why
7:06
because you know I'd prefer that you come in physically to for the office hours but in 2020 I started the process
7:13
of having just zoom office hours I preserved that tradition because that way if you have a question and you're
7:20
working from home or you you know which you shouldn't be it's a Monday Wednesday right after class but if you get back
7:25
home and you want to ask a question you're sick at home you want to ask a question the only thing is if there's somebody in
7:31
my office they get first dips so if you're on Zoom you might have to wait a little bit but I'll keep the zoom link
7:36
on there are two teaching assistants for the class Chris and Zoe they both took
7:42
the class last year they know how much I torture you so they're fully aware of
7:47
every piece of this class they will have office hours but they'll also have review sessions every week now during
7:55
the review sessions all they will do is actually take problems from pass quizzes
8:00
and exams and work through that because I'm not going to work through a single problem in class know it's not what I
8:07
enjoy doing it's not the best use of my time or your time but they will work through those problems so if you feel
8:13
you need that additional help take advantage of the review session so more details will follow in where the review
8:19
sessions are and when now it's probably a little too late
8:25
for pre-season prep but I did send the email out two weeks ago right and I know
8:30
you haven't been reading my emails and this might become part of a pattern so I'll act like you read my emails and
8:35
I'll create a device we have no excuse saying I didn't see that email but I suggested that there are very few things
8:42
I will draw on on this class but three things I would like you to bring in the class that'll make your life easier and
8:48
mine too the first is I would say some terrible things about accountants and I mean every word of it but let's face it
8:56
our raw data in business comes from accounting
9:01
does that mean you have to know debit and credit and accounting rules frankly I don't know debit and credit I couldn't
9:06
care less about what accountants call of their rules but you have to be able to tell me the difference between gross
9:11
income operating income and net income if you're still struggling what's the difference that's a signal that your
9:17
accounting didn't stick in in theory you've all taken your accounting class right I said in theory
9:25
I don't know how much of it stuck know but if you feel it's not stuck and the way you'll know is when you open up a
9:31
financial statement and you really get lost right away right after the revenue
9:37
everything else is some mysterious I if that's the case I've created my own version of an accounting
9:44
class which would make an accounting professor blanch because I break every accounting rule it's the accounting that
9:50
I need for this class so if you feel Shak you in accounting and you want to revisit that class it's 12 sessions it's
9:57
about 3 and 1 half hours all together together it might be an investment worth making second skill
10:04
set is statistics if you taken a statistics class at least in theory
10:10
again the tragedy of Statistics classes is you forget them almost immediately
10:15
after you finish them thank God that class is over I will never need it again the old days when you had books
10:22
you could sell them back to the bookstore this was the first book you sold back okay and that's almost TR
10:29
tragic because if you think about what we face not just as Finance people but
10:34
as human beings we're inundated with I w't even call the DAT
10:40
with with data right information we're we're facing information Overlord and the problem
10:46
with that is you're getting pulled in different directions you say how do I break the
10:53
tie I have five different things that claim to tell the truth but they're all telling the statistics is designed for
11:01
big and contradictory data so for not even for this class in
11:07
general I think it's a good idea to revisit statistics and say what can I take from the class and you might take
11:14
only 20% of the class to use to make sense of that data around me so in
11:19
corporate finance you're going to have a lot of data coming at you in fact I will argue that your biggest complaint is not
11:25
going to be I can't find enough information it's going to be I finding too much information and it's pulling me in
11:31
different directions so here again if you feel your statistics class did not
11:37
stick I've created 12 session version of a statistics class again from the perspective of somebody who's not a
11:44
statistics person at heart but somebody needs statistics in finance in in
11:49
valuation wherever I run into it so if that's your weakest length fix it and
11:56
finally how many of you taking foundations Sim multaneously okay few it's not it's not
12:03
a prere for this class but there are a couple of tools out of the foundations class that we'll draw on first of course
12:10
time value of money if you're still struggling with what present value is
12:15
intuitively I know you got the PV button worked out in your calculator or your computer but it's still not quite sure
12:21
what it means you got to get that out of the way right because Finance is almost entirely
12:27
time value of money so if you feel that those very basic
12:33
financial pieces are shaky I have a minimalist foundations class looking at
12:39
instruments and time value that you will lose in the class so if it's too late for pre-season prep right now but if at
12:46
any stage you find that these are the things that are impeding your progress in this class
12:52
you're you're getting stuff in this class go back and revisit them I will torture you
13:00
every day and this is a promise not a threat every day from today till May 5th
13:06
which is your last day of class and probably spilling over three days after that you will get an email from
13:12
me not a text message I you know so I will stay with emails and every day the
13:18
email will cover something different so right after class today there will be an
13:24
email about what we did in class today said I was in class already I know physically you were here but sometimes
13:31
you can take a mental break and when that happens you come back from that
13:37
mental break and say what the heck happened this email might say this is what happened right so it's not like a
13:43
know Twilight Zone episode this is where we are on Tuesday which is tomorrow
13:49
you'll get What's called the corporate finance puzzle of the week it won't start this week because we won't have
13:55
done enough but starting next Tuesday every week I'll put out a puzzle you're saying what scary thing is that it's
14:02
going to be something topical for instance I might say what's a big business news that's come out over
14:09
this weekend deep secret I mean it today the market is
14:16
entirely structured on deep seek so next week my question might be if you're in
14:22
corporate finance working for NVIDIA or working for Microsoft how does
14:29
the entry of deep seek change your core business story so it'll be something
14:36
general where you can use the tools of corporate finance to at least start answering the questions something that's
14:42
a news of the week that we're building around again structur around what we're doing in class on Wednesday again there'll be an
14:49
email after class telling you what there is and essentially following up on the
14:54
class and on Thursday I will send out an email about your project you're saying what project in a few minutes I will
15:01
describe what you're going to be doing through the course of this class your project is already started you just
15:06
don't know it yet we'll talk about how this project plays out and every
15:11
Thursday I will try to guilt trip you why because I know exactly what's
15:17
going to happen the project is actually not due till May 5th I will nag you about staying on
15:25
course with the project but I know exactly what's going to happen which is you're going to ignore my nagging you're
15:31
going to fall behind and the 12th week you're going to say I have to pick a company yeah you were supposed to do it 12 weeks ago so think of this as a guilt
15:40
Tripper I said this is where you're supposed to be on the project I'll let you fill in the Gap as to where you
15:45
actually are and what to do to cover that gap on
15:51
Friday I'll do what's called an in practice webcast sounds fancy but I will take something that we do in class that
15:59
go get that and you say where the heck do I get that this will take you to the process so for instance we'll talk about
16:04
risk- free rates in a couple of weeks how do you get a risk-free rate in Indonesian rupia we'll go through this
16:10
in class but then you'll say where did he get the data how did you build it up the webcast will take you through those
16:17
the grunt work of collecting the data you can estimate a risk-free rate in Vietnamese Dong or Indonesian
16:24
reper or Brazilian r on Saturday they will be a newsletter
16:29
what news not much news but basically to tell you this is what we did last week you'll notice a lot of revisiting and
16:37
part of the reason for that is in a big class you can get lost especially as you get to the middle of the SE middle of
16:43
the semester and things get busy think of this as a GPS saying this is where we
16:48
are in the class this is the page we are in the lecture notes so the newsletter is really about grounding you and where
16:54
we are in the class so if you get lost you can say okay I can see where I need to get on Sunday there'll be a
17:02
newsletter saying this is what's coming in the next week so you're ready for the classes for the week so this process
17:08
will play out I have the tendency to send really long emails I would say I'm
17:13
sorry but I really am not so I'll act like I'm sorry but I'm not because in the emails I'll throw in things that
17:20
I've been reading saying hey you know think about this in the context of what we talked about in the class
17:27
today now terms of classro there are very few I'd like you to be here he's
17:33
saying where else would I be I will make it easy for you to not be here and then
17:39
I will ask you to be here in what sense every session is going to have a zoom
17:44
link and be recorded that way you have no excuse for missing the class you can be in whatever
17:51
part of the world you have to get over the time difference but you can watch the class if you can't watch it live you
17:56
can watch the recording and and some of you will be tempted around the second or third week
18:03
because you're sleeping in you thinking sleeping in at 10:30 hey my you know you
18:08
people are capable of sleeping in till 2:00 my son yes I was supposed to meet my son for brunch yesterday we had
18:15
brunch at 3:00 I said call me when you wake up now he's now is out there what
18:22
but basically you know whatever he does on Saturday night clearly spills well over into Sunday morning but he called
18:29
me at 2:00 said Dad I just woke up I said okay I kind of plan for this brunch becomes br br becomes dinner God only
18:36
knows what meal you're eating but it doesn't really matter so if you will be
18:41
tempted at points in time saying do I really want to put my clothes on can I stay in my pajamas all day
18:49
maybe I can just do this I would like you to be here obviously it's better to
18:55
be here on time but if we can make it 30 I'd rather have you here 30 minutes late than not
19:01
at all but if you cannot make it you're sick God's sakes don't come in with
19:07
covid or the plague or into the class I don't want you you're physically sick stay at home to watch it but you cannot
19:13
make it you'll be able to keep up at the class all you need to bring to the class
19:19
is the lecture note packet and of course if you have an iPad or a or a regular
19:24
computer you can download the digital version I'm not going to cause the rain forest in Brazil to shrink because I
19:30
want to teach this class if you feel you need a physical copy by all means print out the packet just don't do it on the
19:37
printers downstairs because then I will hear about it because you print what 450
19:42
pages and times 250 people you'll kill the printers and then they'll reach out
19:49
to me and I'd prefer that not happen so if you have if you if you if you have
19:55
work if you're working somewhere part-time print off their printers I don't care I ruined their
20:00
printice so if you do miss a class catch up on
20:05
the class don't let it go too far behind I know there's a bright there's
20:12
bright space I never use it I get on there because I'm supposed to and they harass me if I don't and then it just
20:20
sits out there I don't like closed Learning Systems I didn't like what preed this is the fifth or sixth
20:26
Learning System that NYU has used I ignored all of them bright space will have its uses
20:32
because the grades will obviously be easiest to check there so you will see your recorded grades if you forget what
20:38
you got in a quiz you can go look it up there but almost everything that happens in this class will happen through the
20:44
web page for the class and that link is right there I've sent it a couple of times so think of that as the platform
20:50
for all of the material for the class there is a YouTube channel that will carry the the lectures it'll also carry
20:59
all the in practice videos so basically it's there what is that for while you're
21:05
taking this class I think this semester there are 10,535 people will also be taking the
21:11
class unofficially for no credit and no payment you know but they'll be watching
21:18
just the YouTube videos on there and they won't obviously they won't be dropping in on office hours or know
21:25
hacking the zoom session in live no but the YouTube channel basically will have all of the
21:32
sessions remember I talked about an email every day you will at some point in time probably block
21:38
me why because I'm you know killing your mailbox and then you will when I talk
21:44
about remember that email I sent last week you're going to say what email I'm going to take that excuse away
21:50
as well because every email that I send you will go into what I call the email Chronicles which is going to be
21:56
classified by date this is the email so you you have no excuse for saying I didn't see that email it's there in the
22:03
Chronicles so if you don't check your emails because that's not what you do the Chronicles will carry
22:09
it few more logistical details the class is obviously on Google Calendar so you can see when the quizzes are there is
22:16
zero flexibility in terms of moving quiz dates I'll talk about what will happen if you have to miss a quiz which I
22:22
understand can happen part of the reason I have no 250 people I can't afford to have too many moving pieces is things
22:29
start to blow up on me so the Google Calendar will tell you I think the final exam date is finally out so I'll put
22:35
that up as well you know but that's going to list out the dates for the class no I do have this blog where I
22:44
dabble I dabble in things that interest me so it's really about me I'll write about whatever interests me and maybe
22:50
some of the things that interest me will interest you as well you've seen the first three data updates I sent for this
22:57
year I sent the links if you get a chance to read them you don't have to be a finance person the First Data update
23:03
basically is about how I update the data the second is about what US equities did in 2024 the third is about slicing and
23:10
dicing the equities with sectors with Industries market cap price I mean basically all the different ways you can
23:16
slice and dice but know I am already pondering a
23:21
piece on deep seek and saying how does deep seek change the value of companies
23:26
which companies are going to be most directly impacted which are indirectly impacted what does this all mean for
23:32
that AI hype hope whatever you want to call it that's been driving markets for the
23:39
last year I do have a Twitter feed and it's all about numbers for me I mean my
23:45
endgame in life is to always have more people on my social media platforms than
23:52
my kids collectively do so I just know so what I'm saying is if you have four email addresses put them all on Twitter
23:59
and put them on as followers I can take four over one every single time but you know it's basically I use Twitter not to
24:06
have online debates or discussions I've never ever responded to a tweet because
24:12
bad things happen when you do but it's my announcement device It's very
24:17
effective at saying I just posted or I just put the data up and then I leave it alone but if you want on time
24:25
announcements that something has come up that's a new data item this is where you find
24:31
it in terms of required material the only thing you need is the lecture
24:38
notes do you can if you feel that a book will help there's actually a book that
24:44
parallels this it's called applied Corporate Finance it's a book it's that's in its fourth edition and
24:49
basically everything you see will be in there so it's supplementary you don't need to use because it's obscenely overpriced I would not buy my own book
24:57
and I can't in good conscience ask you to buy the book but if you feel wealthy
25:03
I don't know what that means right how you feel wealthy with the tuition recharge you I don't know but if you do
25:09
still feel wealthy and you have excess cash and by all means buy the
25:14
book practice prompts there will be practice prompts at every exam and quiz
25:20
I've ever given in a corporate finance class which goes back I think to 1986 is
25:26
online you so there you want practice quizzes
25:31
you'll have more practice quizzes than you ever wanted to see this is actually
25:37
a curse not a blessing and you will see very quickly what I mean by that as you start approaching quizzes but every
25:44
examine quiz I've ever given is online you can find it and along the way you know whenever
25:51
we use a model or data you're going to see it online as well so logistically the class is structured to be all almost
25:59
a class you can take sitting in your bedroom and never leaving it so if you have some
26:05
strange mental problem you cannot leave your room you can still finish this
26:11
class let's talk about this class what is Corporate Finance anybody want to give that a try
26:19
what is Corporate Finance before I jump in with my definition let me back up how many of
26:26
you have taken I should have done is right off the stop an undergraduate corporate finance
26:32
class okay how many of you are Finance people you worked in in some kind of a finance
26:40
job it could be banking it could be Consulting it could be in a corporate fin how many of you have Finance
26:47
people I want the everybody in this class to look around this is not 1986 in
26:54
1986 if I'd asked that question or even in
26:59
1995 the vast proportion of this class at least its turn would have been
27:04
Bankers coming back for Rehab right I mean basically you spent two years in banking you came back this
27:11
was like a conduit so this class would have been recovering Bankers coming back to say I really don't want to recover
27:17
but they kick me out anyway right this is a very very diverse class many of you
27:24
have not just not worked in finance this might be the very first finance class you're
27:34
taking but among the people who took corporate and it also means that you cannot don't use the excuse of I'm not a
27:41
finance person I'm not going to let you get away with that excuse in this class I will make you a finance person by the
27:47
end of this class I'm a bit of a te televangelist on this Dimension my idea
27:53
of this class succeeding is at the end you say I see the light I'm no longer a marketing person said thank you
28:01
God but if you've taken a corporate finance class you should be able to answer the question I you an entire
28:07
class with this title what is Corporate Finance anybody want to
28:15
try come on I'll make you look good even if you give me the wrong answer I'll reframe it to make it the right answer
28:20
I'm very good at that you said you taken a corporate finance class right somebody you took a
28:26
corporate finance class hey one of the problems with this room and I apologize for this is there's no place to put your
28:33
name plates okay and it's awkward for everybody say I am so and so so if I say
28:39
you it's not because I know I don't see you it's because I really can't see your name so I'm what's your name Jose what
28:48
what exactly do you think Corporate Finance
28:55
is interpretation is it just interpretation though you
29:00
sound I mean we sound like psychics then right it has to be more than inter it has to be know something that covers the
29:07
actions of a company you said that's interesting what kinds of
29:12
actions are we talking about all the action not just the
29:18
financial actions because and the reason I asked
29:24
this question is at least in New York the definition of corporate finan gets really cramped because it's set by what
29:31
investment Banks call corporate finance what do investment Banks call corporate finance usually the
29:37
interaction between firms and financial markets that's where investment Banks come in right which is are you raising
29:43
Capital are you doing a deal calling that corporate finances like a podiatrist claiming to be a general
29:49
practitioner you're looking at toes all day really no position to tell me what
29:55
the rest of me looks like it's it's a very narrow vision of corporate finance so I'm going to give you my definition
30:01
of corporate finance it's incredibly self-serving I asked you how many of you are in finance you know what every one
30:07
of you has been in finance you just didn't know it Corporate Finance covers
30:13
any decision made by a business it involves the use of
30:18
money you're in marketing you're in the company spend money on marketing you an
30:25
HR you don't think people money gets SP if you spend money it's a corporate finance decision you see how incredibly
30:32
self-serving this is you know do they still have that orientation when for for
30:38
first year mbas where they make you come in a week before class starts they and then they try to tell you that
30:44
everything you know is worth nothing and that the next two years is what matters it's complete
30:50
brainwashing and I've never really wanted to be involved in that process because you make false promises that you
30:56
know you can't deliver but about seven or eight years ago they made the mistake of inviting me to talk to the
31:02
orientation class why because this has become a right of passage for stern MBA
31:08
is this is an elective and for some reason it's an elective that draws a big chunk of the first year MBA class they
31:15
said can you come in and talk to these entering mbas about what your class is about so I went in with a chart and I
31:22
don't think theyve ever they're ever going to invite me back again I said this is what the MBA program looks like
31:27
there's my class and then all these other classes you're going to be taking that are in service of my class they
31:33
just don't know it yet I'm going to argue that everything you do is going to feed into my
31:39
corporate finance class your strategy class is going to lay out the foundations for my forecasting what the
31:46
future is going to be in terms of revenues and margins and cash flows your marketing class your accounting class
31:53
every class in a sense is a piece of this class so so whatever you choose to do
31:59
this class is going to follow you around and perhaps haunt you it is every single
32:05
thing in a business is Corporate Finance so I'll lay out the objectives
32:10
for the class and then I'll try to use the rest of this class to flesh out the objectives you ask me to describe this
32:16
class first it's a class that is applied what does that mean when I first taught
32:23
Corporate Finance I was given a syllabus to teach the syllabus of course like every discipline includes all the things
32:28
that are supposed to be taught in the class in the first semester I taught it
32:33
I had no choice I taught the syllabus that was essentially Corporate Finance syllabus in every single class with the
32:40
textbook that went with it and then I started asking the
32:45
question why do I need to know this or why does somebody in this class need to know so I started applying a very simple
32:53
rule that started to prune my syllabus I said if it cannot be applied I don't
32:58
care and if I don't care why should everybody else care so I went through the syllabus taking out things that were
33:04
supposed to be there that I could see no way of applying in the real world what's left in this class or what
33:12
the version of the class you see is my version of corporate finance which is about hey if I can't apply it I can't
33:17
use it everything in this class is going to be applied I'm going to peripherally again reference your project you're
33:23
saying what's a project going to be about you're going to pick a company and everything we do in this class
33:28
everything you're going to apply on that company and if you can't apply it I'd like to know because I'm going to take
33:34
it out of the class if it cannot be applyed second this is a big picture class by now even after your first
33:41
semester you probably become a little cynical about the word big picture because every class G claims to be a big
33:47
picture class I'm going to show you the big picture on the next page of corporate finance and I'm going to stay
33:52
true to that big picture everything we do in this class is somewhere in that big picture
33:58
third and this is going to sound a little sick I think Corporate Finance is
34:04
fine it allows pieces to fit together what I'm looking for are what I call aha
34:09
moments in this class where something connects for you where something you've never been able to quite understand why
34:16
is Invidia worth 4.3 trillion or why do companies buyback
34:22
stock are a BuyBacks good thing or a bad thing maybe some at some point in this
34:27
class you will at least start to get the pieces of understanding why companies do what they do and why they sometimes do
34:34
stupid things so I've laid the the objectives in the very last session I'm going to
34:40
come back and revisit those to see if I've delivered so on May 5th you'll see that same page pop up with a very
34:46
different end game is did we did we get get that done so let's
34:53
start by first getting you out of what I call the accounting mindset
34:59
now to the degree that the accounting class at least partially stuck I'm going to take you through an accountant's
35:07
favorite financial statement only accountants love this statement but we'll talk about why and
35:14
as I go through this you're going to get a little perspective on how accountants think about the world and why you need
35:20
to snap out of it if you're an accountant my condolences you spend a lifetime getting
35:27
here I'll have to slap here it's more in fact I have more work with in this class
35:32
know getting the class through to accountants than any other subgroup and we're going to see
35:37
why let's take an the accountant's favorite financial statement if you step back there are three core financial
35:44
statements right anybody want to name them go
35:50
ahead exactly income statement and tell me at least in Broad terms what each is
35:55
supposed to do what's the income statement supposed to do
36:02
or made made don't not made because it's always backward looking right made so it tells you how much the company earned
36:09
which is which is a big deal what is the statement of cash flows telling
36:15
me how so basically it's like looking at a checkbook how much cash came in how much cash went out what's left and
36:22
what's the accounting end game with the balance sheet
36:29
what you own and what you owe right that's basically what each is supposed to do let's not dress these up as most
36:35
GL more glorious than what they're supposed to be so at least in theory a balance sheet is supposed to show what a
36:41
company owns what it owes and you say what about the difference that's what
36:47
your Equity is supposed to be worth as a business let's go through an accounting balance sheet because along the way
36:53
you're going to see the inconsistencies that have built up in accounting as we know it and why the accounting balance
37:01
sheet has less and less value in it and I'm using the word value
37:08
deliberately here so let's see how much of your accounting stuff if you look at
37:13
accounting balance sheet broadly speaking there are four classes of assets you have long lived physical
37:22
assets land building equipment machinery accountants are big on tangible versus is intangible we see why
37:29
that is but if you can see it it's no if you have longly physical assets like
37:35
factories and equipment and you see a number in an accounting balance sheet I'll stay with you how do accountants
37:41
come up with that number let's take of you know plant or
37:52
equipment somebody want to help him out with physical real assets what is the rule in much of the world
38:00
still it's what you pay Mark to Market has not made migrated there right so
38:06
it's what you originally paid for something but that's not the number you see so what's happened to it while it's
38:12
sat there it's been why at least count Say it'll probably get less know valuable over time so it's what you
38:18
originally pay already you can see the first problem here right if I bought a
38:24
building in New York City in 1965
38:29
and I see the building on my balance sheet what's going to be true about the number you see there it's going to be
38:35
completely disconnected from reality but it's accounting stay with
38:41
the accounting mindset we'll snap out of it because it's very dangerous to stay there too long that's physical asset
38:48
land building equipment machinery then you've got short-lived assets what are those inventory
38:54
receivables it's usually under the current assets called column here it's
38:59
still what you originally paid for it but it's usually not that different from the current value why because hopefully
39:04
your inventory hasn't been sitting on your in your store room since 1965 in
39:09
which case you're probably done as a company it's probably 6 months old so here it's still what you paid for it but
39:15
it's closer to current value then you've got investments in
39:22
other companies and here accountants all all all over the place
39:28
let's take Microsoft what's its most high-profile investment in another
39:35
business open AI they've invested $4 billion in open
39:41
AI so if I went to account the Microsoft and at least till Friday open AI was
39:47
presumably worth a lot of money and we'll talk about what's happened since but if I went to Microsoft's
39:55
balance sheet what I what am I going to see as the of open AI that 14 billion that they invested it could go to 100
40:02
billion 200 billion but it doesn't get Mark to Market because it's classified as a Strategic investment that Microsoft
40:09
did this and it's true right they build did this because they want to build open AI into their products so if you have a
40:16
cross holding in another company or another business or an asset and it's to help your core business it'll be
40:23
recorded at what you originally paid for it and the discon conect from reality
40:28
there can be immense I remember valuing Yahoo in 2014
40:34
in 2014 what was Yahoo's business a search engine that nobody
40:40
searched on and in a mail program that I think only people over the age of 75 had heard
40:46
about Yahoo male so I valued the business being as generous as I could I came up with the value of 4 billion the
40:52
stock was trading at 39 billion he's saying that is weird you know what explained the
40:57
difference it was actually not it was not overvalued what what did Yahoo own that
41:05
wasn't caught in the 4 billion they own pieces of two companies
41:11
one was a company called Yahoo Japan that's a standalone publicly traded company and for some reason the Japanese
41:16
still like Yahoo search engines don't ask me why so it's worth it was worth about at that time now 35% was worth
41:24
about10 billion and the other was a 21% holding in a Chinese company
41:33
called wrong Chinese company try again you're very close Alibaba you know how they got the 21%
41:40
they were a venture capital investor in Alibaba and they invested about a billion dollars best thing Yahoo ever
41:47
did right because by 2014 Alibaba was in the verge of going public and if you
41:53
remember it went public at 200 billion what's 21% of 200 billion it's not a
41:59
trick question it's 40 billion plus if you looked at Yahoo's balance sheet that
42:04
Alibaba holding was recorded at less than a half a billion you think that is
42:09
weird that's what they originally invested as a VC so with cross Holdings
42:15
you can see that some cross Holdings are going to bear no resemblance but if you open up a soft bank and you look at its
42:21
Holdings in I wouldn't say we work that's too much of an open wound to pick at but look at its Holdings of Alibaba
42:28
which is and soft bank is also a big investor in Alibaba what are you going to
42:34
see because soft bank is a VC company viewed as a tra it's viewed as holding
42:39
its investment for trading it has to Mark to Market he's saying this is a mess I
42:47
agree so when you look at a financial balance sheet and you look at Holdings in other companies you might have to dig
42:53
through the footnotes to see what those recordings are because it could be Mark to Market it might be recorded original
42:59
cost it might be you know adjusted for Book value it could be all over the place when accountants claim to be
43:06
consistent they're lying call them out there's no consistency in this process
43:11
and then you get to intangible assets let's start with the generic question that is nothing to do with accounting of
43:16
Finance are there companies out there that get the bulk of their value from things you can't
43:23
see take the seven largest companies in the world they the mag seven right what's
43:30
Apple's biggest
43:35
assd it's not the physical plants it
43:40
is it's everything right the operating system The Styling remember they John I
43:45
legendary styling this is a company that actually thought about styling so when you look at your iPhone you're seeing the results of tens of millions of
43:52
dollars should the edges be you know curved or should they you think that is of ways they clearly don't think so
43:59
intangible assets what's Google's biggest intangible assd again not that
44:04
stupid campus they've built on in California that's a playground it's a search box that we
44:12
still go to and we want to find things whether we trust it or not you take the mag s maybe Tesla might
44:20
have some physical aets that Fremont plant and the in the plant know three
44:26
other four other plans they've added on but for all of these companies the bulk of the value comes from things you
44:33
cannot see inang so let's start with an acceptance you look at the big companies
44:39
of the 21st century most of their value comes from things you cannot see in tangibles so you know what the last 30
44:47
years accountants have been wrestling with how to bring in tangibles on the
44:52
amount of time and energy they've spent trying it's called fair value accounting which is an
44:58
oxymoron because you can either do value or accounting but they keep trying the end game is you want to bring in T and
45:04
it's a worthy mission right and given how much time they've spent and how much
45:09
they talk about you think they must have done a pretty good job by now at the end of 2024 I took every
45:16
balance sheet in the world it's easy to do now the data is there Capital IQ you can download the balance sheet I added
45:22
up the intangible assets on all accounting balance sheets big number it's gone up a lot over the last 20
45:28
years he great accountants are finally catching up but here's the problem 85% of those
45:35
intangible assets still come from one item not what that one item is it's the
45:41
most destructive accounting item ever created it's called
45:49
Goodwill and here's why I call it the most destructive I mean if you worked at KPMG or this was your mother's in terms
45:57
of how your business ran right because you are called in to assess Goodwill and then every year you called in to impair
46:03
that Goodwill this is like a continuing business model for you I'm cutting at the heart of your entire existence but
46:09
I'm going to do it anyway here's why it's the most destructive and meaningless asset of all
46:15
time for Goodwill to manifest itself on an accounting balance sheet what does a
46:21
company have to do buy another company so already you
46:27
can see the basis for the problem if you're the greatest company on the face of the Earth but you've grown entirely
46:33
with Organic Investments there will be no Goodwill on your balance sheet take a
46:38
look at Apple's balance sheet you know how much Goodwill There is almost
46:44
nothing why what is the last big acquisition that Apple
46:50
did Beats that was like petty cash this company has never
46:57
done a big acquisition if you don't do a big acquisition there's no
47:04
Goodwill conversely if I go out an aquira company let's play a game so let's say you go out an aquira company
47:10
for $10 billion right how do I measure Goodwill what is it it has to be the
47:16
difference between two numbers what is it the what are the two numbers that that are used to get good
47:23
work what you paid is a purchase price and let's see how much accounting brain watching you gone through what's the other number so the purchase price is
47:30
observable what's the other number I compare it
47:36
to let's keep the liabilities out but let's at least you know it's but what number would I put to those
47:44
assets if you've taken an accounting class you told the fair value of those there's nothing fair or value about it I
47:51
live in the value domain to call that fair value is I think an insult to both words
47:57
it's accounting book value dressed up so here's what happens after you do an
48:03
acquisition a team from earnst and young shows up at your offices what do they do
48:08
they do a three-month elaborate kabuki dance you watch this see that and after 3 months they say we've done an
48:14
assessment of your assets and it look like the value that you had three
48:20
billion is wrong it should really be 3.13 billion they'll add more decimals
48:25
to show that they've done a lot of work in the 3 months but it's Book value dressed up dressing up book values like
48:32
dressing up a turkey it's tough to hide that scrawny neck right but you dress up Book value
48:40
you come up with this number you got A10 billion purchase price you got a $4 billion dressed up Book value as an
48:47
accountant you got a $6 billion problem right to explain away why because until yesterday you were telling me the
48:53
company was worth four oops it's worth 10 billion so what do you you take that $6 billion
48:59
difference and you put it on the balance sheet and you call it Goodwill and why
49:04
do you need to put in the balance sheet because balance sheets have this very unpleasant requirement which is
49:10
they have to balance why does good will exist to make balance sheets but it's a
49:15
plug variable you'd be amazed how often I get emails from people saying I've a companied 5 billion in Goodwill how much
49:22
should I pay for it to which my response is a plug variable what the heck are you paying for every year I do send suggestions to the
49:29
accounting rule writers which they never seem to take so about a decade ago I sent a suggestion that we rename
49:36
Goodwill in algebra when you have two numbers that don't equate what do you do you say plus X you can make any two
49:42
numbers equal to each other I said let's call Goodwill X if you open an accounting balance you see Goodwill it
49:48
sounds good right it sounds like there's stuff behind it let's just call it X that way you'll never feel the urge to
49:54
pay for it already you can see that when you look
49:59
at the accounting balance sheet for a company and from that you extract the value of equity in a company because
50:05
when you look at the shareholders equity on a balance sheet the classic book value of equity you know what you're getting
50:12
you're getting a reflection of the company's entire history it's the ultimate backward looking number so you
50:19
took Coca-Cola and you look at it share of equity it includes the capital raised by Coca-Cola at its IPO what was that I
50:27
have no idea but it's a long long long time ago plus retain earnings every year if
50:34
you're writing it mathematically that's what share is ACC it's the ultimate backward looking
50:40
number when you first look at a company that's what you see right the accounting balance she and already you can see why
50:47
with the rise of companies like Apple and Google and Nvidia and Tesla
50:52
accounting balance sheets are losing their value
50:58
they're losing because you're really learning nothing about a company but looking at its accounting balance sheet
51:03
so here's what I'm going to ask you to do when you look at your company you're going to see an accounting balance sheet so this assumes you picked a company
51:09
looking at the accounting balance sheet I want you to in your mind start thinking about what I call a financial
51:14
balance sheet and at one level it's far simpler than an accounting balance sheet and another level it's far more complex
51:21
you look at the asset out of the balance sheet there are only two items right I don't divide the world into tangible and
51:27
intangible fixed and nonfixed I divide into things you've already done as a company and things I expect you to do in
51:33
the future things you've already done in the plaz I'm going to call Assets in place
51:39
Investments you've already made I'm going to put a value on them could they have a big value yes for a compan like
51:44
Coca-Cola what's in there the original soda you created the syrup etc etc all the beverages you've acquired all the
51:50
geography zero that's assets in place the second item looks kind of
51:57
mysterious growth assets that's a value I'm attaching to things I expect you to do in the future things you might not
52:03
even have thought about yet I'm giving you a value say why would I do that we do it all the
52:08
time talked about Invidia 4.3 trillion how much of that 4.3 trillion is for
52:14
things they've already done on a good day maybe half a
52:19
trillion say what about the other 3.8 trillion scary as it might
52:24
be this is what you're building building in for things you expect them to do where that magical AI space right people
52:31
have to buy chips and those chips are going to come from Nvidia and how are you going to run AI without those chips
52:36
and on Friday evening we attached a value of 3.8 trillion went to sleep you slept through the entire weekend you
52:42
wake up on Monday morning you a lot of sleep deficit to
52:47
overcome what's changed what what do deep seek do it
52:53
basically tries to do many of the things that AI people claimed you could not do with powerful chips with data that AI
53:00
people said you need a lot more data what's going to happen to the 3.8 trillion you're going to reassess right
53:07
the value of growth assets could go down go up things are going to happen the nature of growth assets based on
53:13
expectations of future and those expectations can change it's
53:18
Dynamic it's going to be different for different companies what about Coca-Cola's growth
53:24
assets there's not much there right what are you going to do where are you going to go you're
53:31
already in every part of the world your beverage is kind of hit saturation point and if anything you could argue that
53:37
maybe it's going to get less valuable over time maybe the sugar problem finally catch up with
53:43
them for Coca-Cola the bulk of the value comes from investing them already made so one of the things to do when you look
53:49
at your company I don't care what company you pick it's look at where the value for your company comes from you haven't put a number yet but at least
53:56
get a ass sets am I looking at a company the bulk of the value comes from the future am I looking at a company where
54:03
the bulk of the value comes from the past doesn't make one company good and the other company bad but it'll give you a very different set of corporate
54:09
finance choices As you move along and in this financial balance sheet what you see as Equity is not a historical number
54:17
it's always a forward-looking number could you be a company that invested a hundred billion doll in the past and
54:23
you're worth nothing now sure I was reading about this company
54:29
called Constellation Energy it's I don't know it's zoomed in the last couple of years why because
54:35
it's been building these very large because AI at least in the story until
54:40
Friday was you need powerful chips you need these these these centers data
54:46
centers that require immense amounts of power and there's an ecosystem that's
54:51
been built around we Supply the power to these a I wouldn't be surprised constant lost half its value today doesn't mean
54:59
the market is crazy it just means that expectations can shift the value of equity in a financial balance sheet is a
55:06
forward-looking number and it can change at the drop of a
55:13
hat so I promised you the big picture let me deliver I'll tell you up front if you get this page the rest of the
55:20
classes I sing on the K this is the only page that matters because it covers every core first principle in finance
55:28
and let's lay it up I told you Corporate Finance about any decision that a business makes that involves the use of
55:34
money right but I'm going to classify those decisions into three buckets you can have investment decisions what are
55:40
investment decisions projects you take Acquisitions you make even deciding whether to put a water cooler in your is
55:47
is an investment decision and the first principle in corporate finance is when you make
55:53
investment decisions make sure you earn a return on those
55:58
Investments That exceeds some minimum acceptable hurdle rate that sounds like a buzzword right so for the moment I'm
56:05
not going to fill in the details but I'll give you the sub principle that governs how we think about hurdle
56:10
rates I know most of you might not be Finance people but tell me whether this at least makes common is is common sense
56:17
the hurdle rate should be higher for riskier Investments then for safer Investments everybody agree with that no
56:23
I haven't told you how much higher we still have a lot of work to do be and should also reflect where you raise the
56:29
capital did you borrow the money or use your own money so the minimum exceptable
56:35
Hur rate should reflect the riskiness of the investment and how you raise money to fund that
56:41
investment you say how do I measure returns in corporate finance return should be based on cash
56:49
flows already let's pause there as opposed to what what the entire
56:55
accounting classes is bottom line what's the bottom line in an income statement it's earnings I'm saying look
57:02
return shouldn't be based on earnings why because you can't spend earnings that sounds mysterious we'll come back and talk about it cash in cash out cash
57:10
flows should reflect the timing of the cash flows would you rather get know I'm
57:18
going to ask would you rather get cash flows earlier or later somewhere I mean this is something
57:24
we knew I mean I with each of my kids they're all grown up now the age of four or five we I had this test to figure out
57:31
whether to put aside money for college and this is usually right after they started getting their allowance and
57:38
usually they'd get their allowance in Saturday and I would call each of them in in different points in time and they
57:44
say would you rather wait till Saturday to get your allowance or would you rather get it today which is
57:52
Monday and here's the answer I didn't want to hear they said I'll wait till s Saturday I'll said you know what I'll
57:58
take your college fund let's figure out something practical for you to do you're not going thank God my first three kids
58:04
all said I'll take it today my fourth kid I knew I said extra money aside because here's what he asked he said is
58:10
it the same allowance dad that's time value of money right you
58:17
wait till Saturday if I give you a higher allowance that's time value it's amazing how we dress this up and we
58:23
forget the basics as we go along but but when you measure returns those returns should reflect not just how much you get
58:29
as cash flows but when you get the cash flows the timing and there should be no
58:35
side effects built in there's no garnishing allowed in investment analysis seeing what are you talking
58:40
about many of you have worked at businesses where you grind out numbers for an investment you and you don't have
58:46
to be a finance person you're looking at investment you grind out the numbers and the numbers don't fly you know what I
58:52
mean by don't fly investment doesn't look good and then somebody in the room
58:59
comes in with a garnishing like what there are strategic reasons for this investment
59:06
strategic is the most dangerous word invented in business basically means the numbers
59:11
don't fly but I really really really want to do this there's AI in this space somewhere
59:18
we'll be in China I now you these are garnishing you're throwing them in after the numbers have been thrown in saying
59:25
hey want to take this project can we find a good word to justify it no I'm not going to let you get by my job is to
59:33
take the big word say let's see what that means I'm not going to dismiss your strategic considerations I'm going to
59:38
bring them into the numbers investment principle says take Investments at earn a return greater than your minimum
59:44
acceptable hurdle rate of course we have a lot to work to do right we have to measure risk and
59:50
convert to a hurdle rate we have to bring the mix of debt and Equity but that's why we have 25 sessions left at the class
59:56
let's turn to the financing principle the financing principle has two parts I said there were two ways you can raise money debt or Equity borrowed money or
1:00:03
your own money which one should you use I can't give one answer that applies to all companies but here's what I can say
1:00:09
find the mix that minimizes your hurdle rate you see the advantage you'd rather
1:00:15
have a 9% hurdle rate than a 10 because it lets you take more Investments it makes your Investments more value what
1:00:21
will that mix be again a lot of work for us to do but it definitely will not be the same for every
1:00:27
company and if you ask me what kind of debt should I take I'm going to turn the question back on you and say tell me
1:00:33
something about your assets what you invested I know you haven't taken the
1:00:39
class yet but I'm going to put you on the spot and you're going to be my right
1:00:44
don't look back I'm looking at you as I said that's a problem I have to point you I could do the laser but I could
1:00:50
blind you so I know I just let this you ready so you're going to be my advisor I
1:00:56
am an infrastructure company in Portugal what kind of debt should I take
1:01:03
first longterm or shortterm and why did you say very
1:01:12
longterm because I'm taking long-term projects and what currency should I take the Deb
1:01:21
in so if I build a toll road and I collect tolls in Euros my debt that was
1:01:26
easy it should use long-term Euro debt you know how much how many mistakes
1:01:32
in corporate finance come from taking something simple and making it
1:01:37
complicated the rule in corporate finances when you go out to borrow money borrow money in a way that the cash
1:01:44
flows reflect the assets you Tak are there cases where you might have to make adjustments yes you might be having an
1:01:51
infrastructure project in Zimbabwe and you might be unable to raise money in Zimbabwe because Capital
1:01:58
markets are not developed you might raise your money in Europe or the US you're going to get a mismatch but at
1:02:03
least you're aware there's a mismatch and you can do something about it so financing principle says go out and
1:02:08
borrow money and get a mix that minimizes your hurle rate and match up
1:02:13
your debt to your assets and then there comes the dividend principle and people lose their minds on
1:02:21
it if you cannot find Investments that earn your hurdle rate
1:02:28
let's say your hurdle rate is 9% the best you can do is make 7 and a half
1:02:33
per. I've heard man say that's the best I can do no that's not true there is another option which is what can a
1:02:39
company do if it cannot find Investments at make its hurdle rate give it back to the owners you're a
1:02:46
private business take there's no glory in growth for the sake of growth in surviving for the sake of surviving or
1:02:53
sustainability for the sake of sust sustainability I'm again I'm going to pick on sustainability and and other
1:02:59
glorious words we've got into the business lexicon if your core reason for
1:03:04
existence is gone just go away
1:03:10
shrink it's a Dividend Decision if you're a public company it gets a little Messier right you can't just take cash
1:03:16
out you got to return the cost and cash and you said you can pay dividends and until 1980 in the US that was the only
1:03:22
way you got cash back but I'm as we go through the CL you're going to see a trend that is well beyond pushing back
1:03:29
on which is increasingly what's the other way in which companies give cash and return cash they're BuyBacks so
1:03:36
already you can see the place buyback is just a version of a cash return that is different we talk about why that
1:03:42
switches happen it's pluses and minuses but which one should you use depends on
1:03:48
what your shareholders prefer right they're getting the cash if I am Google
1:03:53
and have a lot of cash which one do you think they preferred to get the money in dividends or
1:04:00
BuyBacks you think so you know if you look at I mean how many of you investors in alphabet I I
1:04:07
call it Google still or shareholders in alphabet you share why did you buy shares in alphabet because of the
1:04:13
dividends you expected to collect on the stock I wanted price appreciation this
1:04:18
is a stock I had in that segment of my portfolio where I said I want this which means the shareholders who
1:04:25
self- selected to invest in Google did it because they wanted to get price appreciation they didn't in fact I don't
1:04:31
want to get dividends you know why cuz April 15th is coming
1:04:37
up the minute I get dividends I have to pay taxes on it so if you're a Google and you have
1:04:45
lots of cash but if you're conad or you are City
1:04:53
back and you have a lot extra cash you can't then what should you
1:04:58
do who holds shares in ConEd and City probably no I don't want may sound agent
1:05:05
but ages but it's probably either Pension funds or 75 year olds right
1:05:10
people who want the cash I'm not saying it's a bad thing they they buy these stocks for the
1:05:16
dividend there is no right answer should I pay dividends or BuyBacks look at your shareholder base the answer is right
1:05:22
there and in doing all of this in corporate fin we have a singular objective I'm trying to maximize the
1:05:29
value of the business that's a loaded objective how the heck do I measure value what the heck is the business
1:05:36
that's the end game and we'll talk about that but this is the big picture everything in this class is tied to
1:05:42
something in that big picture so I'm going to use that big picture to bring home some core themes
1:05:49
in corporate finance that are going to be pretty straightforward first is
1:05:56
much of corporate finance is common sense in fact let's take the much out all of corporate finance is common sense
1:06:02
because think about it many of you never taken a finance class or a corporate finance class is any of the stuff that
1:06:08
I've said so far surprised you I mean what have I said if you raise money at 9% please please don't take Investments
1:06:15
That Make 8% I knew that already so if you can raise money at 8% rather than 9%
1:06:20
use the 8% you saying I knew that already and nothing I look at can make even 8% you know take the money out of
1:06:27
the business I knew that already and that shouldn't surprise you you know how
1:06:33
old corporate finances as a discipline 37 I'm sorry 67 years old can
1:06:41
trace it back to a paper written in 1957 by Martin Miller and Franco
1:06:47
Modigliani until 1957 corporate fin the glorified accounting
1:06:52
class 67 years old how long have people been running business businesses definitely more than 67 years
1:07:00
probably some very good cave business people their disruption was fire fire
1:07:06
never seen it before this is the disruptive force or tools extra sharp
1:07:13
right good business people through it takes an incredible ego on the part of
1:07:18
corporate finance people say until we came along you guys just were picking business making these decisions randomly
1:07:26
good business people Through the Ages have always understood these first
1:07:32
principles that's why you can be a great business person and not just not have an MBA but never have gone to
1:07:39
school one of India's largest companies Reliance was founded by durai Amani was
1:07:44
a fifth grade Dropout but an incredibly shrewd business person you can him
1:07:52
right you could try the garnishing with him and say you know what this investment R is only 7% our cost of
1:07:57
capital is 10 but that's okay strategic it have probably thrown you out of the
1:08:03
office conversely there are people out there with mbas and phds who seem to have lost touch with
1:08:11
these first principles so here's my suggestion whenever we do something in this class
1:08:17
that doesn't connect with you in terms of common sense I want you to push back
1:08:23
even if you don't feel if you feel to intimidate push back in class come back and say I don't quite
1:08:30
get this because I want you to make that Common Sense connection not just as an abstraction of this is the right thing
1:08:36
to do but this is why it's the right thing to do second corporate finan is focus one of
1:08:44
my problem with any institution that doesn't have a focus is you're all over the
1:08:49
place right and any given day you're trying to do something different it's nice we have Focus that f Focus comes
1:08:56
from the central objective which is maximizing the value of the business and in some case with publicly traded firms
1:09:02
that gets narrowed done we'll talk about why to maximizing stock prices you know why in corporate finance
1:09:08
we like that because it's observable when you make a decision I can look at the corporate the stock price effect it
1:09:14
comes with consequences but that Focus means everything we do in corporate finance we can ask what's the right way
1:09:20
to do it because we know what the end game is if you don't know what the end game is how do you know what the right
1:09:26
thing to do is we'll talk about the push back against this particular end game he say
1:09:33
why maximize value why not maximize revenues or growth we look at the Alternatives but everything in corporate
1:09:39
finance is built around that end game because it tells us how to pick projects how to fund them how much to pay in
1:09:46
dividends but I think that every disagreement you and I are going to have
1:09:52
over the next 15 weeks is not going to be about the mechanics is about the end game so when you disagree with Something
1:09:59
Corporate Finance doing say I don't like BuyBacks turns out that you might not
1:10:04
like BuyBacks because you think businesses have should have a different end game I'm going to spend probably
1:10:10
what you think will be a disproportionate amount of time on the endgame in business why we chose the
1:10:15
objective we do what are the Alternatives I'm in a sense going to inoculate you against all the critiques
1:10:21
you're going to hear about Corporate Finance in your other classes because
1:10:26
I think there are good arguments that can be made but I we'll look at the CEST
1:10:31
those arguments I have 12 books my 12th book came out in September of last year it's
1:10:39
called the corporate life cycle what does it do it argues that businesses go through a life cycle just like you and I
1:10:48
do and businesses behav just like human beings behave I'm not going to be
1:10:53
mysterious the startup is like like a baby needs constant care and attention
1:10:59
and lots of capital with a huge mortality rate why because two-thirds of startups
1:11:05
don't make it to the toddler face you're a toddler company you fall
1:11:11
you get up you sometimes fall and don't get up you're staggering your business model is Shak you gain huge mortality
1:11:18
rate let's say you make it to your teenagers what are you doing to your teenagers what teenagers around the
1:11:23
world do I've had four go through my house and here's what each of them did they'd wake up in the morning look in
1:11:29
the mirror and say I have lots of potential what can I do today to screw it all up that's a teenage mindset
1:11:37
complaining about it doesn't make a difference because that's a teenage mindset when I bought Tesla in
1:11:43
2019 I bought it because it was undervalued but the post I wrote about why I bought it I titled it my corporate
1:11:50
teenager you know why because it has lots of potential but every morning one man gets up he looks in the mirror say
1:11:57
what can I do today to screw it all up I buy the
1:12:04
package you take Elon Musk with all its Dimensions when you buy it good and bad
1:12:10
it's part of the package you make it through your corporate teenagers you're at the peak of your life enjoy it while
1:12:16
it lasts what does the peak of your life look like as a human being is when you can go to bed at 3: wake up at 6:00 and
1:12:21
be a fully functioning human being I don't even try that to think of about trying that
1:12:27
today enjoy the peak of your life because Everything You Touch turns to
1:12:32
God Invidia until Friday again was at the peak of its life what
1:12:40
happened over the weekend I mean what's what my daughter has been not looking
1:12:45
forward to this last year is she turns
1:12:50
30 in April and she's convinced the world is going to end you know know why
1:12:56
cuz after 30 comes middle age it's such a doom filled word right
1:13:02
you're going to be middle age who who amongst us is I want to be middle-aged one
1:13:07
day but it's coming right and what happens to middle-aged companies they've got to act like middle-aged
1:13:14
people don't overexert yourself you might have a midlife crisis
1:13:20
and buy a Ferrari a company might have a midlife crisis and do a b big acquisition but
1:13:26
guess what a Ferrari doesn't make you 25 again for a brief moment you had the dream but it doesn't last but enjoy
1:13:33
middle age because after middle age comes even worse
1:13:38
stuff like old age and then after old age comes dementia and after dementia comes you pass away and companies go
1:13:46
through the cycle when you pick your company one of the things I'd like you to think about
1:13:52
where in this life cycle is my company
1:13:57
let's try this you know where do you think apple is let's let's start where do you think you know open AI is in
1:14:07
this it's probably like a baby but I'm not sure whether it's Damian from you
1:14:13
know it's like a baby but you're very terrifying baby right it could be have all these no there's no business model
1:14:20
here it's it's a baby with very strange powers and you're not sure what'll happen next
1:14:26
right what about palente where do you think you'd put it what does palente do mysterious
1:14:33
things with the CIA and the FBI you're afraid to ask what it does because you might end up in Guantanamo
1:14:39
Bay it's clearly a company with you know young company perhaps approaching the
1:14:45
peak of its life in viia we talked about the peak of its life but that might pass
1:14:50
every other one of I mean if you look at most of the other mag 7even you look look at alphabet you look at meta
1:14:57
they're middle age they're good middle age they've kept themselves in shape middle age is not always a that's what I
1:15:03
tell my daughter as well it's not the end of the world you can be alphabet type middle age or you can be craft
1:15:09
Hinds type of middle age right what does craft Tes do 57 types of ketchup all of
1:15:14
which taste like crap and cheese that stays liquid for the rest of Eternity it's a terrifying
1:15:21
thought right but for a while people loved it but now its customer base is 65
1:15:27
and older it's probably old age and that old age comes
1:15:32
with its own consequences couple of years ago I valued Bed Bath and Beyond where would I
1:15:38
put Bed Bath and Beyond in the life cycle all you have to do is walk into a Bed Bath and Beyond and you know now
1:15:45
this is before they shut down this is not long for the world we're not even show what you sell it's a terrifying
1:15:51
retail concept right you walk in Bed Bath and Beyond should looked at the Beyond first there's bed and bath I kind
1:15:58
of get it what is the Beyond whatever they want and for a while it was a concept
1:16:06
that caught on I know lived in New Jersey for a long time I no longer do for lots of different
1:16:13
reasons but I lived a few miles away from the bed b first bed bath and it took off
1:16:21
until it got to point people didn't go in there two years ago I valued Bed Bath and
1:16:27
Beyond it was like valuing a corpse there's nothing there there's no real end game
1:16:33
here and there's nothing wrong with that business is a if you tell me where you're in the life cycle I'll tell you
1:16:39
which part Which principle you should be focused on if you are palente what are you focused on primarily the investment
1:16:46
principle how much can you borrow are you kidding me you're losing money what the heck are you doing borrowing money
1:16:52
first rule in holds is stop digging if you're in one how much should you pay in dividends
1:16:57
absurd you can't be paying dividends as you age as a company all of
1:17:02
those principles will start to evolve I'm going to talk about the life cycle off and on the class because it's
1:17:08
amazing how much of what you see in a company can be explained about where it is in the life cycle and when it gets
1:17:14
dysfunctional it's because a company is refusing to act its
1:17:19
age right Intel throwing billions of dollars into The Foundry business
1:17:25
because they wanted to be like tsmc or billions into AI because they wanted to be like
1:17:31
Nvidia company overreaching trying to be something that they cannot be and fourth Corporate Finance is
1:17:39
universal in fact it's unfortunate that there's a word corporate in the title right because what does that lead you to
1:17:44
think what we're going to talk about applies to companies it's not true this is something that applies to all
1:17:51
business small or large public or private developed or emerging Market I have never felt the need to write an
1:17:57
Emerging Market corporate finance book or a corporate finance book for doctors or corporate I mean there is really it's
1:18:03
Corporate Finance of first principles Supply are there estimation differences obviously we're going to talk about how
1:18:09
a private business hurdle rate might be different from a public company's hurdle rate how an Emerging Market company an
1:18:15
Argentine company because the constraints it faces might have to kind of alter the way it but the principles
1:18:22
don't change which brings me to the final theme which is if you violate these
1:18:28
first principles somebody will pay maybe not you but somebody will pay I talked about
1:18:35
people with mbas and phds sometimes thinking the first principles don't apply to
1:18:40
them and then they act in accordance it always ends up catching up with them or
1:18:46
somebody else let me give you an example so Indonesian taxi cab company in the
1:18:51
1990s called steady safe I'm sure none of you have heard of this company it's no longer around there and
1:18:58
the story will tell you why so early 1990s Indonesia is booming steady safe
1:19:04
decides it's going to expand which means what going out and buying more taxi caps to put
1:19:10
on so you're going to be my banker you want to be my banker in this case Tedy
1:19:15
say had a bank called parag but you're going to be my banker and I'm going to ask you some very simple question about
1:19:21
funding this expansion I'm going to borrow money to buy taxi
1:19:27
caps and what type of debt should I take you're allowed to ask me back question
1:19:33
so ask me the question you need to know the answer to decide on the terms of the
1:19:39
Deb but in this case cabs how long do the cabs last right let's say I tell you 10 years and then run them into the
1:19:45
ground the debt should be 10 year debt what currency Indonesian repia 10year
1:19:51
Indonesian repia debt that was a no-brainer let's play out what actually happened in steady safe went to an
1:19:56
investment Bank investment bank called parag Green a bank that's no longer in existence either and they asked them
1:20:02
this question and they were told take 10year debt but in US Dollars and they were
1:20:09
given a very alluring reason and what do you think that reason was it's cheaper to borrow money in US
1:20:17
Dollars than in Indonesian repia very dangerous word to use cheaper it is lower the rate is lower we'll talk about
1:20:23
why that they said it's cheaper and per Ste say listen to them they went out and borrow the money in US dollars
1:20:29
they fund this growth and then to give per to give steady Safe Credit they went to parag and said should we be worried
1:20:36
about the fact that we're borrowing in dollars to fund these rupia assets the Investment Bank said don't
1:20:42
worry about it the Indonesian government has pegged the exchange rate and promised us that nothing bad will
1:20:49
happen famous last words because in the mid90s the Indonesian government
1:20:55
devalues the rupia by 65% so let's wake up to the morning
1:21:01
after it steady say what's happened to your asset they're all rupia assets in dollar terms they worth 35% of what they
1:21:07
were yesterday right if your debt had also been rupia that it would have been marked down you wouldn't have been happy
1:21:13
but you'd have been okay you'd have survived but their debt is in dollars their assets are in rupia so guess what
1:21:20
happened to steady say they went bankrupt and the only good thing that happened happened is they took their
1:21:25
Investment Bank down with them it happens far too infrequently if you ask
1:21:31
me because they're always there at the wedding they're never there at the divorce actually they have two teams a wedding lawyer and a divorce but
1:21:37
basically they make money on both sides but just because Goldman tells you
1:21:43
to do something that violates first principles doesn't mean that you're going to get away with it or McKenzie
1:21:50
and I'm astonished sometimes that the advice that comes out of these places and I said that doesn't make any
1:21:56
Corporate Finance sense so the entire class as I said
1:22:02
structured around that big picture so you'll see rather than a traditional syllabi we're going to start with
1:22:08
starting next session about know much of the session going through session four we're going to talk about that objective
1:22:14
why did we pick that end game what are the Alternatives and along the way we're going to talk about things like
1:22:19
sustainability and ESG and stakeholder wealth maximization that I'm sure you've seen right up to the service in other
1:22:25
classes and why we don't go down those road then we're going to spend about you
1:22:30
know eight sessions talking about hurdle rates measuring risk bringing to hurdle rates three sessions on
1:22:37
returns followed up by a financing mix dividend policy and then we're going to
1:22:42
go back to value and become more explicit about how do all these decisions tie into value so I will see
1:22:49
you on Wednesday and get ready for an email a really long email that will come exactly at 12:30
