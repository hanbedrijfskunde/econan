## Key Observations for Students:

### 1. **Spectacular Revenue Growth**
- Sales revenue increased by **€2,575 million (+35.9%)** in just one year
- This reflects the strong demand in the defense sector following geopolitical tensions
- However, changes in inventory capitalized decreased significantly (€696M → €167M)

### 2. **Operating Leverage**
- While revenue grew by 26.4%, EBIT grew by 50.0% - this shows **positive operating leverage**
- EBIT margin improved from 12.5% to 13.8% (+1.3 percentage points)
- This indicates Rheinmetall is becoming more efficient as it scales

### 3. **Cost Structure Analysis**
**As % of Sales Revenue:**

| Cost Category | 2024 | 2023 |
|--------------|-----:|-----:|
| Cost of Materials | 49.8% | 54.8% |
| Personnel Costs | 24.3% | 28.5% |
| Other Operating Expenses | 11.5% | 12.4% |

Notice how all major cost categories **decreased as a percentage of sales** - excellent scaling!

### 4. **Profitability Ratios**

| Ratio | 2024 | 2023 | Interpretation |
|-------|-----:|-----:|----------------|
| **Gross Margin*** | 50.2% | 45.2% | Improved pricing power or efficiency |
| **EBIT Margin** | 13.8% | 12.5% | Strong operational performance |
| **Net Margin** | 8.3% | 8.2% | Stable despite higher interest costs |

*Gross Margin = (Sales - Cost of Materials) / Sales

### 5. **Tax and Interest Analysis**
- **Effective tax rate increased** from 22.7% to 27.1%
  - Higher profits = higher taxes (progressive impact)
  - Possibly different geographic mix of earnings
- **Net interest expense increased by 41.5%** (€82M → €116M)
  - Reflects higher debt levels for growth financing
  - Interest expenses rose from €111M to €135M (+21.6%)

### 6. **Discontinued Operations**
- Loss from discontinued operations: €87M (2024) vs €44M (2023)
- This relates to the sale of the small-bore pistons business
- Important to separate these from continuing operations when analyzing future performance

### 7. **Return Metrics**
- **Return on Sales (ROS)**: 8.3% (Net Income / Sales)
- **EPS Growth**: +34.0% year-over-year
- Strong shareholder value creation despite operational challenges

### 8. **Common-Size Analysis**
**As % of Sales:**

| Item | 2024 | 2023 |
|------|-----:|-----:|
| Total Revenue | 104.1% | 111.8% |
| EBIT | 13.8% | 12.5% |
| Net Income | 8.3% | 8.2% |

The gap between Total Revenue (104%) and Sales (100%) comes from inventory changes and other income.

## Questions for Students to Consider:

1. **Why did the EBIT margin improve despite significant growth?**
   - Hint: Look at cost ratios as % of sales

2. **Is the increase in interest expense concerning?**
   - Compare growth rate of interest expense to growth in EBIT
   - Calculate interest coverage ratio (EBIT / Interest Expense)

3. **How should we interpret the discontinued operations?**
   - Should this affect our valuation of the company?
   - Is this a one-time event or recurring issue?

4. **What does the EPS growth tell us about shareholder returns?**
   - Is the EPS growth sustainable?
   - How does it compare to revenue and profit growth?

5. **Calculate the Interest Coverage Ratio:**
   - 2024: €1,345 / €135 = **10.0x**
   - 2023: €897 / €111 = **8.1x**
   - This shows Rheinmetall can easily cover interest payments - healthy financial position!

## Additional Ratio Calculations:

### Operating Profit Margin (Operating Result / Sales)
- 2024: €1,478 / €9,751 = **15.2%**
- 2023: €918 / €7,176 = **12.8%**

Note: Operating Result (€1,478M) differs from EBIT (€1,345M) due to PPA effects and special items.

### Return on Sales Improvement
The company improved profitability at multiple levels:
- Operating level: +2.4 percentage points
- EBIT level: +1.3 percentage points
- Net income level: +0.1 percentage points

## Teaching Notes for AI-Assisted Analysis:

This income statement demonstrates how students can use AI to:
1. **Extract and structure** financial data from annual reports
2. **Calculate key ratios** automatically (margins, growth rates, coverage ratios)
3. **Perform vertical analysis** (common-size statements)
4. **Perform horizontal analysis** (year-over-year comparisons)
5. **Identify trends and patterns** in operational performance

**Critical skill:** Students must still **interpret** these results and understand the **business context** - AI is a tool for speed and accuracy, not a replacement for business judgment!
